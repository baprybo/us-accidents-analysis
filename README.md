US Traffic Accident Analysis (2016 - 2023)

Project Overview
This project looks at over 7 million traffic accidents across the United States to figure out why they happen and how we can make roads safer. By looking at weather, time of day, and road features, I developed three specific recommendations for transportation officials to help reduce the number of severe accidents.

Key Features
Cloud Data: I used Amazon S3 to stream the data, which means I didn't have to download 7 million rows to my laptop.
Interactive Visuals: I built a Tableau Dashboard that lets you click through different states and weather conditions to see safety trends.
Data Cleaning: I organized messy real-world data into clear categories for easier analysis.

Tools I Used
Python: The main language used for the analysis.
Jupyter Notebook: Where I wrote and ran my code.
Tableau: The tool used to create the interactive dashboard.
GitHub: Where this project is hosted and shared.

What's in this Repository?
DS_Capstone_Notebook.ipynb: The notebook containing my Python code and analysis.
images/: A folder with the charts and the project banner.
README.md: This file, which explains the project.

Interactive Dashboard
You can open and interactive with a dashboard I created for this project on Tableau Public:

How to Use This Project
Download: Click the green "Code" button at the top and select "Download ZIP."
Open: Extract the files and open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
Run: Make sure you are connected to the internet so the code can pull the data from the cloud (S3).
